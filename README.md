# Let's Learn to Learn first because you already know the content of this repo is all CSE.

## 0. The Principles

1. `Learning vs. Winning The System` Focus on long-term learning and doing good work, not on how to ace the test. [The lesson to unlearn](http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html)

1. Define your measure of success, you need to have the `drive and persistence`

1. `Embrace the Obstacle`: you’ll be bad first until you get good,

1. The Obstacle (I suck!): Overcome the obstacle to learn a valuable skill.

1. `The Dip`: know when to quit, make a smart choice (not everyone can become an Olympic athlete)

1. `Compound Learning`: learn in chunks instead of cramming, Learn small chunks per day to get long term results.

   - > improve by 1% every day and in 70 days you will double

1. `Failures don’t count against you`: people know you right now, they don’t care about the test you failed five years ago

1. use failure as a feedback loop

1. mindset: `choice vs. chore`: shift your focus from “I must do that” to “I want to do that.”

1. `Framing`: use a frame/context to change your perspective, Adopt a beginner mindset. I am not there YET.

1. `Pareto principle (80/20 rule)`: eliminate until you’ve boiled it down the essentials

1. focus on the critical 20% and make efficient use of your time,ask yourself

   - > "Is this the best use of my time"

1. Robert Greene - “Mastery”: 3 principles: `curiosity`, `value learning about all else`, `skill-stacking (uniquely combine your skills)`

1. the trick is to have skills that work well together, but are varied enough to allow you to stand out (avoid the most obvious path)

1. `Happiness factors`: identify the areas/things/people that make you happy - if you’re happy, you will be able to learn better

1. monitor your happiness factors, identity 5 things that make me happy.

1. `Productivity time`: find the time where you are most productive

1. `Self-learning paradigm`: find your identity as a self-learner

## 1. Some Lies

1. `Follow your passion` is terrible advice - you don’t need to be passionate to start to become good at something and enjoy improving your craft (craftman’s mindset).
   - Shift from passion to intrinsic motivation.
   - Aim for creativity, control and impact instead
1. `You can avoid risk`, you have to get out of your comfort zone, you can’t play it safe all the time, view risks as challenges and learn from failures.

1. `Trust this one person` find various teachers and opinions, unique perspectives, combine different sources and form your own opinion

1. `The 10,000 Hours Rule` (become a master by practicing more) it's not always true.
   - practice smart, not hard (efficiency)

## 2. The Pillars

1. `Everything is a Game`: Belief in growth over a fixed mindset.

   - Adopt a growth mindset: everything is trainable. Seek out challenges to grow.
   - If you believe you have control over your life (“locus of control”), you realize that you can it’s in your hand to improve your skills instead of blaming undesirable results on external factors.

2. `The Feynman Technique`: To understand something, you need to be able to explain in SIMPLE TERMS. You’ll also be able to identify gaps in your knowledge.

   - Choose a concept you want to learn about
   - Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6
   - Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better understand it.
   - Review and simplify

3. `Trunk-Based Knowledge`: Focus on fundamentals coz they are not gonna change (learn the fundamentals)

4. `Efficiency Trumps Grit`: Manage your time and energy, be efficient, instead of hustling all the time.
   - Work Smart, remember that time is limited.
